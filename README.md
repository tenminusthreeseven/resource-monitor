# Python Server Resource Monitor & Email Alert

This is a simple Python script that monitors your computer or server's CPU and memory usage.  
If usage exceeds set thresholds, it sends an email alert to notify you â€” helping you catch performance issues early.

## Features

- Checks CPU and memory usage every 5 minutes.
- Sends an email alert if CPU usage exceeds 80% or memory usage exceeds 75%.
- Limits alert emails to once every 12 hours to avoid spamming.
- Logs all resource checks and email alerts to a log file (`server_monitor.log`).
- Cross-platform: works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
